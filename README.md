## BACKGROUND
I have wanted to make my own text-adventure game for some time now. I originally tried in JavaScript but quickly found out that I was being far too ambitious far too quickly and burned out. I then tried again in Java, but gave up yet again when trying to do too much too quickly. This time, utilizing Python, I am taking it much slower. I have very limited experience in Python and by completing this passion project, I hope to come away with a much firmer grasp on concepts.
